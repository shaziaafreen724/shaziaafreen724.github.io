                <h1>Software Development</h1>
                <p>
                    Software Development is a set of activities dedicated to creating, designing, programming, documenting, testing, and maintaining applications, frameworks, and other software components. Software development is the process of writing and maintaining the source code at a broader level. Hence, software development may include research, new development, prototyping, modifications, software engineering, maintenance, or any other software product or application activities.

                <h2>Types Of Software Development</h2><br><br>
                <p>
                    Software development is the core activity of the IT industry and is divided into 10 main types. These types are as follows. <br><br>
                    <h3> #1 Application Development</h3> <br><br>
                    <img src="Top-Mobile-App-Development-Companies-in-Delhi-1.png" alt=""> <br><br>
                    Application Development is developing a computer program or a set of programs to assist users, businesses, or organizations in using functionalities. These are the standard applications that perform traditional duties on operating systems. 
                    <br><br>
                    Application Development languages: Java, C/C++, C#, Python, and much more. <br><br>
                    <h3> #2 Web Development </h3><br><br>
                    Web Development is the process of developing a website for the internet. The web Development process can range from developing a single static page to complex web applications. 
                    Web development involves the development of thousands of interconnected web pages that only a web developer can organize. The Web Development Company is booming, thanks to the latest Web Technologies and APIs that let plugins be used in a website.
                    <br><br>
                    Web Development Technologies: HTML, Javascript, PHP, Python, Ruby and Rails, ASP.NET, Django, C/C++, and much more.
                    <br><br>
                   <h3> #3 Mobile Development </h3> <br><br>
                    Mobile Development, also known as App Development or Mobile App Development, could be defined as creating applications that run on mobile devices such as iPhones and Android devices. Recently these apps have been successful in running on Windows 10 platform. 
                    <br><br>
                    Mobile Development Technologies: Android, Swift, Objective C, HTML5, Java, C#, Javascript, and much more.<br><br>
                    <h3>#4 Data Science</h3> <br><br>
                    <img src="data-science.png" alt=""> <br><br>
                    Large chunks of data are not much valuable until you know what to do with it. That’s where the role of Data scientists comes into play. They find value from the data.Scientific applications are developed based on the mined data. As machines need large amounts of data to learn and make their own decisions, Data Scientists ensure that the data is presented in the correct form to be used in AI applications. 
                    <br><br>
                    Data Science Technologies: MATLAB, Python, C/C++, and much more.<br><br>
                    <h3>#5 Software Tools Development</h3> <br><br>
                    Consumers do not use this type of Software, but it is crucial for the software development Industry. It builds tools for other software developers to test and code. Apart from development and testing, this software help developers to maintain the industry standards in their development.
                    <br><br>
                    Tools Development Technologies: Java, Python, C++.
                    <br><br>
                    <h3>#6 API Development</h3> <br><br>
                    API Development or Application Programming Interface is the program that developers build that acts as a puzzle piece across different operating systems. They allow any 3rd party developer to interact with the tools or functions that API relates with. 
                    <br><br>
                    APIs are written for specific platforms, and each API has the programming language of the platform or device for which it is particularly designed.<br><br>
                    <h3>#7 Embedded Systems Development </h3><br><br>
                    Embedded Systems Development is specialized for the specific system that your machine or device runs on. This type of software development deals with coding skills needed for embedded systems like Arduinos and Raspberry Pi.
                    <br><br>
                    Embedded System Technologies: Embedded C, Assembler, Python, Arduino, and Java. 
                    <br><br>
                    <h3>#8 Security Software Development</h3> <br><br>
                    <img src="security-software.png" alt=""> <br><br>
                    White hat hackers and cybersecurity experts work for the betterment of companies and their critical data. The cybersecurity team develops software to keep the organization’s important assets safe from theft, viruses, and malicious attacks.<br><br>
                    <h3>#9 Cloud Computing </h3><br><br>
                    Cloud computing services use a network of remote servers to store data and access services instead of local servers or personal devices. The developers involved in cloud computing software development develop the software to power cloud storage applications. Typical examples of cloud computing software are Amazon Web Services (AWS), Onedrive Storage, and Github.
                    <br><br>
                    Cloud computing Technologies: Java, XML, R, Erlang, Google’s Go, Clojure, and much more.<br><br>
                   <h3> #10 Backend Development or Database Development </h3><br><br>
                    Back-end Development, also known as Database Development, goes on behind the scenes in the system. The back-end or the server-side of the website is where the data is stored. <br><br>

                    Database management is the prime aspect of back-end development. It is also the backbone for organizations that hold large amounts of data. Backend developers manage and organize a large amount of data in the backend development process.
